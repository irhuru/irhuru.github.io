      <description>Ibex Farm 🐐 is an online resource that allows you to create psycholinguistic experiments that you can then send to participants. Ibex Farm runs using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 💻.
The cool thing about it is that it is highly customizable and it allows you to measure reaction times (RTs) and to randomize items, among other things. You can check out the Ibex Farm website here and its documentation here.</description>

      <description>This project compares the English and Spanish subtitles from the movie Frida (2002) 🎥. Subtitle files were imported into R and examined using several natural language processing (NLP) tools and techniques, such as:
 Tokenization Bigrams Sentiment analysis  Results were also plotted for a better interpretation 📊📈. Some of the packages used include:

      <description>Heritage speakers are a specific type of bilingual speakers who grew up exposed to a home language different from the one spoken by majority in society. When heritage speakers start school, they learn the majority language which, in most cases, ends up being their dominant language 🗣️.
In the context of the United States 🇺🇸, some colleges offer language courses specifically designed for heritage speakers, whereas others offer only mixed language courses (i.</description>

      <description>This corpus comprises several texts which are transcriptions of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale as narrated by different bilingual speakers. All narratives were produced in Spanish and were elicited using a children&amp;rsquo;s book (containing only images, not text) 📖.
Bilingual speakers were either born in the United States or in a country in Latin America (e.g., Mexico, Venezuela&amp;hellip;), and they were fluent in both English and Spanish.
Transcriptions were included in a single .</description>

      <description>Structural priming is the tendency to repeat or more easily process a syntactic structure that a speaker has been recently exposed to. Linguistic experiments that use structural priming try to understand how language is represented in the mind 🧠.
This project used a structural priming paradigm to examine how different speakers (i.e., native speakers, second language speakers, and heritage speakers) process ditransitive constructions in Spanish.
The experiment consisted of a pre-test, treatment, and post-test.</description>
