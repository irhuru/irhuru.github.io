      <description>The Bilinguals in the Midwest (BILinMID) Corpus documents the Spanish and English spoken in the Midwest of the United States by different types of bilinguals. The corpus comprises written transcriptions of The Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale, which participants narrated orally. This is the first corpus to document the Spanish and English spoken in this region of the United States.
The bilingual speakers who participated in the study were either born in the United States or in a Spanish-speaking country, but at the time they were recorded, they had all lived in the United States for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>The Heritage Language Writing project sought to examine the development of Spanish heritage language learners&#39; writing abilities over the course of a semester. For this project, a corpus was created using written data from a total of 24 Spanish heritage language learners enrolled in a writing course at the college level. The data consisted of essays and other writing assignments that learners completed throughout the semester.
After the corpus was created, data was imported into R and analyzed using natural language processing tools and techniques in order to explore different areas: lexical density, lexical diversity, syntactic complexity, lexical sophistication.</description>

      <title>Automatic Dialect Classifier</title>

      <description>Language detection algorithms help identify the language of a given text. For example, this type of algorithms could determine that a sentence like &#34;Mary bakes a cake&#34; is written in English, whereas &#34;Mar√≠a cocina un pastel&#34; is written in Spanish. This project goes a step further and tries to identify the particular dialect of a text. Specifically, by using machine learning, the algorithm can detect whether a Spanish sentence belongs to the Mexican or to the Peninsular variety of the language.</description>

      <title>Structural Priming</title>

      <description>Structural priming is a psycholinguistic phenomenon observed in language production and language comprehension that consists of a tendency to repeat a linguistic structure one has previously been exposed to. Structural priming has been attested in human-human interaction, but also in human-computer interaction. There is currently a huge scientific debate regarding what structural priming means or why it occurs in the first place.
The Structural Priming project is actually a set of smaller projects that seek to shed light on the phenomenon of structural priming.</description>
