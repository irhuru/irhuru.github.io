      <description>This project uses machine learning to detect the dialect a particular sentence belongs to. Currently, the model distinguishes between Mexican Spanish 🇲🇽 and Peninsular Spanish 🇪🇸.
The model is trained on text data coming from subtitles of movies produced both in Mexico and in Spain.
The project was conducted using Python.
You can read more about it on this blog post or check out the code on Github.</description>

      <title>Haiku Generator</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/haiku-generator/</link>

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/haiku-generator/</guid>
      <description>This project produces a random haiku generator.
By using texts coming from actual books, a Python script automatically extracts words and outputs a haiku (a text that follows the 5-7-5 syllable rule).
Texts were taken from Project Gutenberg, an online library of more than 60,000 books. Among the Python libraries used for this project were SpaCy and SyllaPy.
You can learn more about this project by reading this blog post or by checking out the code on Github.</description>

      <description>Ibex Farm 🐐 is an online resource that allows you to create psycholinguistic experiments that you can then send to participants. Ibex Farm runs using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS 💻.
The cool thing about it is that it is highly customizable and it allows you to measure reaction times (RTs) and to randomize items, among other things. You can check out the Ibex Farm website here and its documentation here.</description>

      <description>Heritage speakers are a specific type of bilingual speakers who grew up exposed to a home language different from the one spoken by majority in society. When heritage speakers start school, they learn the majority language which, in most cases, ends up being their dominant language 🗣️.

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/bilinmid_corpus/</guid>
      <description>This corpus documents the Spanish and English spoken by bilinguals living in the Midwest of the United States. The corpus comprises written transcriptions of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale as narrated by several bilingual speakers. These stories were elicited using a children&amp;rsquo;s book (containing only images, not text) 📖.
Bilingual speakers were either born in the United States or in a Spanish-speaking country (e.g., Mexico, Spain&amp;hellip;), and they were fluent in both English and Spanish, though their level of proficiency differed based on individual variables, such as length of residence in the United States, country of birth, etc.</description>
