      <description>The BILinMID Corpus The Bilinguals in the Midwest (BILinMID) Corpus documents the Spanish and English spoken in the Midwest of the United States by different types of bilinguals. The corpus comprises written transcriptions of The Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale, which participants narrated orally. This is the first corpus to document the Spanish and English spoken in this region of the United States.
The bilingual speakers who participated in the study were either born in the United States or in a Spanish-speaking country, but at the time they were recorded, they had all lived in the United States for a long period of time.</description>

      <description>Open D Express Open D Express is a web-based chatbot that I developed for OpenDialog. Open D Express offers delivery services (e.g., scheduling the delivery of an online order). The chatbot was developed as a demo to showcase OpenDialog&#39;s software capabilities, and it is now part of OpenDialog Academy and OpenDialog&#39;s documentation.

      <description>Research on structural priming Structural priming is a psycholinguistic phenomenon observed in language production and language comprehension that consists of a tendency to repeat a linguistic structure one has previously been exposed to. Structural priming has been attested in human-human interaction, but also in human-computer interaction. There is currently a huge scientific debate regarding what structural priming means or why it occurs in the first place.
The Structural Priming project is actually a set of smaller projects that seek to shed light on the phenomenon of structural priming.</description>

      <description>Haiku generator A haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan and that consists of three phrases, where the first and third line have 5 syllables each and the second one has 7 syllables. This makes a total of 17 syllables per poem which follow a 5-7-5 pattern.
Using the natural language processing library spaCy and a dataset of random texts taken from Project Gutenberg, I developed a haiku generator in Python.</description>
