      <description>In previous blog posts, I discussed the use of software such as AntConc or Voyant to analyze corpus data. Even though these are very helpful, you can only use them to perform the range of default analyses they offer. But, what if you need more customization?

Well, then keep reading because that is totally possible!</description>

      <description>Nowadays, a lot of linguistics research uses language data from Twitter. At every major linguistics conference, there&#39;s at least one or two people (if not more!) discussing the use of language on this popular social network.
