      <description>If you&#39;re into the Digital Humanities, you probably know about the importance of text analysis. Whereas programming languages such as Python or R allow you to do this efficiently, some people prefer to use tools which don&#39;t require any coding skills. A good example of such a tool is Voyant Tools, an open-source web-based application for text analysis. In this blog post, I will show you the basics of using Voyant Tools to analyze a corpus.</description>

      <description>Whether you want to build a corpus to document an interesting linguistic phenomenon or simply want to have language data to train your AI models, the process of data annotation is crucial.
Language data annotation (or text data annotation) is the process of adding labels with relevant information or meta-data. Even though it might seem like a simple process, choosing the right labels for your data is not always easy, as ambiguous data is pretty common.</description>

      <description>If you are into language research, you probably use R to analyze your data. One of the good things about R is that you can install packages to extend R&#39;s basic functions. In this blog post, I&#39;d like to introduce you to a very useful package for language research: koRpus.
Despite its name, the R package koRpus was designed to work with individual texts, and not with a collection of texts (I know, this is confusing!</description>

      <title>A short guide to building a Twitter bot</title>

      <description>I recently discovered the fascinating world of Twitter bots (what&#39;s that?). Isn&#39;t it amazing that a simple computer program can post random stuff on Twitter all by itself? It probably isn&#39;t, considering that we&#39;re in the middle of a tech revolution, but they&#39;re fun to build, so that&#39;s a good enough reason to waste your time creating one!
In this guide, I explain you how to build a Twitter bot from scratch step by step.</description>

      <title>Creating a Haiku generator with Python</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/haiku-generator/</link>

      <description>What is a haiku? I&#39;m sure you have heard the term haiku at least once in your life. Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. These pieces of poetry consist of three phrases, where the first and third line have 5 syllables each and the second one has 7 syllables. This makes a total of 17 syllables per poem which follow a 5-7-5 pattern.
Haikus have become popular in other cultures too.</description>
