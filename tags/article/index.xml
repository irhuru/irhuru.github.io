      <title>Can LLMs understand emojis?</title>

      <description>Emojis are graphic symbols or ideograms that represent not only facial expressions, but also ideas and concepts. Emojis are extremely popular worldwide, primarily in chat and social media. They can appear as an additional element in the sentence, as in &#34;I liked the cake üòä&#34;, or replacing a word, as in &#34;I liked the üç∞&#34;.
From the perspective of large language models (LLMs), emojis are interesting because they convey a semantic as well as a pragmatic meaning.</description>

      <title>Talking to machines: A brief history of chatbots</title>

      <description>Chatbots, although a trendy product now, have existed for decades. Advances in AI have transformed chatbots from simple and rule-based systems to more complex and sophisticated conversational agents. Let‚Äôs dive into the history of chatbots, from their beginnings to the modern AI-driven companions we see today.
ELIZA: The first chatbot (1966) ELIZA was the first chatbot, developed by professor Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. ELIZA was designed to mimic a psychotherapist, responding to users&#39; messages with pre-defined responses using pattern matching.</description>

      <title>Do LLMs have a personality?</title>

      <description>Personality is the enduring set of characteristics or qualities that form a person‚Äôs distinctive character. The science of personality has been long studied by psychologists, and multiple tests have been designed to assess personality constructs.
Interestingly, many of these tests follow a linguistic approach, since they are based on a factor analysis of the language used to describe behavior. For example, if someone says they like to ‚Äúhave everything organized and planned‚Äù, that would correlate with a conscientious personality trait.</description>

      <title>Is learning a programming language similar to learning a natural language?</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/programming-languages/</link>

      <description>Programming languages are systems of notation used for writing computer programs (e.g., Java), whereas natural languages are systems of communication that have developed naturally in human communities (e.g., French). Despite both of them being languages, little is known about whether learning a programming language is similar to learning a natural language.
What does the research say? Traditionally, learning programming languages has been associated with mathematical skills. In fact, this is what happens in most STEM degrees, where students are required to have a solid background in algebra, calculus, and other branches of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Why is there a preference for female voices in AI virtual assistants?</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/gendered-ai-assistants/</link>

      <description>If you ask Amazon Alexa if it is a woman, it will answer &#34;I&#39;m not a woman, I&#39;m an AI&#34;. In fact, the majority of AI virtual assistants are designed to be genderless (think of AI virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, or Google Assistant). After all, they are simply made of code. Surprisingly, most of these AI virtual assistants use clear female voices when interacting with users. But, why is that?</description>

      <title>Have LLMs developed Theory of Mind?</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/theory-of-mind/</link>

      <description>If you are into psychology, you have probably heard about Theory of Mind before. Theory of Mind is the ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs, emotions, or desires, to oneself and others. It basically is the human ability to interpret what is going on in someone else&#39;s head. As you can imagine, Theory of Mind is an important cognitive skill needed for proper social interaction.
Despite its importance, humans are not born with Theory of Mind.</description>

      <title>Can we make LLMs learn in a more human-like way?</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/language-learning/</link>

      <description>The difference between artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence is well known: whereas humans use their brain, their memory, and other cognitive abilities, AI uses data provided by humans. In fact, AI uses a lot of data. For example, large language models (LLMs), a type of generative AI, are trained on huge amounts of data. The Common Crawl archive, which is LLMs&#39; primary source of data, contains around 3 billion web pages and 400 TB of unocmpressed data.</description>

      <title>How human-like are the linguistic abilities of ChatGPT?</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/chatgpt-language/</link>

      <description>The arrival of ChatGPT at the end of last year has sparked a debate about how it could impact several different fields, ranging from education, to content creation, to finance and to many others. This NLP tool is the epitome of generative AI, a type of technology that ‚Äúgenerates‚Äù content, hence the name, after being trained on large amounts of data. In this case, text data.
From a linguistic perspective, it‚Äôs exciting to see how ChatGPT outputs seem natural and convincing, leading many to assert that it behaves in a human-like way.</description>

      <title>The little-known history of synthetic voices</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/ai-voices/</link>

      <description>Synthetic voices, or artificial voices, are part of our lives (who has never talked to iPhone&#39;s Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Microsoft Cortana?). Conversational AI, which largely relies on these synthetic voices, is currently experiencing a boom and its market is expected to grow even more in the next four years.
However, even though synthetic voices might look like a very new invention, the truth is that they have been around for a long, long time (more than 200 years, actually!</description>

      <title>Why is there a need to anthropomorphize language technologies?</title>

      <description>Some weeks ago, we heard about Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer who claimed that LaMDA, a chatbot that can carry unstructured conversations with people, had a &#39;human soul&#39;. He came to this conclusion after having long, deep conversations with LaMDA, which he later shared with The Washington Post.
What&#39;s striking about this case is that an engineer, who&#39;s supposed to have a thorough technical knowledge about how chatbots work, was fooled into believing the chatbot was actually human!</description>

      <title>Can computers change the way we speak?</title>

      <description>Some months ago, I bought my first smart speaker: an Amazon echo. Because I live in the U.S., Alexa&#39;s default language was English. Even though I&#39;m a native speaker of Spanish, I can also speak English, so it wasn&#39;t really a problem for me. However, when pronouncing Spanish proper names (e.g., people or places), I would still use my Spanish pronunciation. It turns out Alexa couldn&#39;t understand me unless I anglicized those names (ugh!</description>
