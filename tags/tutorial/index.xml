      <title>Are there standards for the annotation of language corpora?</title>

      <description>Some weeks ago, I attended a conference where several of the presenters discussed language corpora they had created as part of different research projects. During the Q&amp;A turn of the last presenter, an award-winning researcher and creator of various corpora, one of the attendees raised their hand and asked: “I have attended five talks today discussing language corpora and each corpus employed different annotation schemes. Wouldn’t it be convenient to have a set of standards for corpus annotation that everyone could use?</description>

      <title>Exploring textual data using R Shiny</title>

      <description>In previous blog posts, I discussed the use of software such as AntConc or Voyant to analyze corpus data. Even though these are very helpful, you can only use them to perform the range of default analyses they offer. But, what if you need more customization? Maybe you want to create your own graphs or explore your data in ways that go beyond traditional KWIC analyses and basic word frequencies. Well, then keep reading because that is totally possible!</description>

      <title>An introduction to Voyant Tools for corpus analysis</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/voyant-tutorial/</link>

      <description>If you&#39;re into the Digital Humanities, you probably know about the importance of text analysis. Whereas programming languages such as Python or R allow you to do this efficiently, some people prefer to use tools which don&#39;t require any coding skills. A good example of such a tool is Voyant Tools, an open-source web-based application for text analysis. In this blog post, I will show you the basics of using Voyant Tools to analyze a corpus.</description>

      <title>A simple guide to using AntConc for corpus analysis</title>

      <description>If you&#39;re interested in corpus linguistics, you probably know that some of the things this field involves includes searching for patterns in a group of texts (e.g., find frequent words or collocations). This can be easily done using a programming language like Python or R. But, what if you don&#39;t have much experience with programming languages? Well, this is where a tool like AntConc becomes useful!
AntConc is a free corpus analysis software that can easily help you identify patterns in a collection of texts.</description>

      <title>Phonetic transcription systems you should know</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/phonetic-transcription/</link>

      <description>What is phonetic transcription? Phonetic transcription is the use of phonetic symbols to represent speech. We could say it&#39;s a way to visually represent speech sounds, which is important because orthography often doesn&#39;t represent pronunciation accurately.
Each phonetic symbol represents a sound in a spoken utterance. However, which phonetic symbol we use depends on the phonetic transcription system we follow. This means that the same dataset can be transcribed in more than one way.</description>

      <title>Four key steps for developing guidelines for language data annotation</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/data-annotation-guidelines/</link>

      <description>Whether you want to build a corpus to document an interesting linguistic phenomenon or simply want to have language data to train your AI models, the process of data annotation is crucial.
Language data annotation (or text data annotation) is the process of adding labels with relevant information or meta-data. Even though it might seem like a simple process, choosing the right labels for your data is not always easy, as ambiguous data is pretty common.</description>

      <title>How to get Twitter data</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/twitter-data/</link>

      <description>Nowadays, a lot of linguistics research uses language data from Twitter. At every major linguistics conference, there&#39;s at least one or two people (if not more!) discussing the use of language on this popular social network. Even though doing research on language use on Twitter is quite trendy now, getting the data for research is not that cool. The reason behind this? There are several ways to get Twitter data and each way depends on a variety of factors, which makes the process a bit confusing.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Peter Pan using the R package koRpus</title>

      <description>If you are into language research, you probably use R to analyze your data. One of the good things about R is that you can install packages to extend R&#39;s basic functions. In this blog post, I&#39;d like to introduce you to a very useful package for language research: koRpus.
Despite its name, the R package koRpus was designed to work with individual texts, and not with a collection of texts (I know, this is confusing!</description>

      <title>Transcribing and analyzing speech samples with CLAN</title>

      <description>In a previous blog post, I wrote about automatic transcription software that you can use to speed up your transcription process. However, chances are that you also want to analyze what you transcribe if you&#39;re working on a research project. Measures such as words per minute or lexical diversity scores are quite common in linguistics research. In this blog post, I introduce you to CLAN, a software that will help you with both transcription and analysis.</description>

      <title>A short guide to building a Twitter bot</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/twitter-bot/</link>

      <description>I recently discovered the fascinating world of Twitter bots (what&#39;s that?). Isn&#39;t it amazing that a simple computer program can post random stuff on Twitter all by itself? It probably isn&#39;t, considering that we&#39;re in the middle of a tech revolution, but they&#39;re fun to build, so that&#39;s a good enough reason to waste your time creating one!
In this guide, I explain you how to build a Twitter bot from scratch step by step.</description>

      <title>Creating a Haiku generator with Python</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/haiku-generator/</link>

      <description>What is a haiku? I&#39;m sure you have heard the term haiku at least once in your life. Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. These pieces of poetry consist of three phrases, where the first and third line have 5 syllables each and the second one has 7 syllables. This makes a total of 17 syllables per poem which follow a 5-7-5 pattern.
Haikus have become popular in other cultures too.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to build a dialect classifier</title>

      <description>As a linguist, I have always been curious about how computers can make sense of texts that combine different languages or language varieties. Therefore, I decided to learn more about this and implemented a dialect classifier. That is, an algorithm that would take some text as input and would determine the language variety (or dialect) it represents. To find out how I did it, read this post or take a look at this Jupyter notebook with all the code!</description>

      <description>As a linguist, I often need to find speakers from a particular country or region to gather data on how they say something. However, it can sometimes be difficult to find a large group of speakers from a region you have never been to. In those cases, Amazon Mechanical Turk can come in handy. In this blog post, I explain how you can start using this awesome tool for your linguistic research!</description>

      <description>I recently found out about an R package that allows you to create Reveal.js presentations in R using RMarkdown syntax. If you are like me and love to display cool graphs in your slides, don&#39;t miss this short tutorial!
Why you need to start using Reveal.js in R Okay, so you already know how to use PowerPoint. Why using something different then? There are many reasons, actually, but one of them is that PowerPoint doesn&#39;t allow you to display interactive graphs in your presentation.</description>
