      <title>A short guide to building a Twitter bot</title>

      <description>&amp;nbsp;
I recently discovered the fascinating world of Twitter bots (what&amp;rsquo;s that?). Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing that a simple computer program can post random stuff on Twitter all by itself? ðŸ˜Žâœ¨ It probably isn&amp;rsquo;t, considering that we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a tech revolution, but they&amp;rsquo;re fun to build, so that&amp;rsquo;s a good enough reason to waste your time creating one!
In this guide, I explain you how to build a Twitter bot from scratch step by step.</description>

      <title>Creating a Haiku generator with Python</title>

      <description>What is a haiku? I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have heard the term haiku at least once in your life. Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ. These pieces of poetry consist of three phrases, where the first and third line have 5 syllables each and the second one has 7 syllables. This makes a total of 17 syllables per poem which follow a 5-7-5 pattern.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to build a dialect classifier</title>

      <description>As a linguist, I have always been curious about how computers can make sense of texts that combine different languages or language varieties. Therefore, I decided to learn more about this and implemented a dialect classifier. That is, an algorithm that would take some text as input and would determine the language variety (or dialect) it represents. To find out how I did it, read this post or take a look at this Jupyter notebook with all the code!</description>
