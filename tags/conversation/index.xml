      <description>Some weeks ago, we heard about Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer who claimed that LaMDA, a chatbot that can carry unstructured conversations with people, had a &amp;lsquo;human soul&amp;rsquo; ðŸ¤¯. He came to this conclusion after having long, deep conversations with LaMDA, which he later shared with The Washington Post.
What&amp;rsquo;s striking about this case is that an engineer, who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to have a thorough technical knowledge about how chatbots work, was fooled into believing the chatbot was actually human!</description>
