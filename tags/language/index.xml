      <description>Some weeks ago, we heard about Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer who claimed that LaMDA, a chatbot that can carry unstructured conversations with people, had a &amp;lsquo;human soul&amp;rsquo; ðŸ¤¯. He came to this conclusion after having long, deep conversations with LaMDA, which he later shared with The Washington Post.
What&amp;rsquo;s striking about this case is that an engineer, who&amp;rsquo;s supposed to have a thorough technical knowledge about how chatbots work, was fooled into believing the chatbot was actually human!</description>

      <description>Nowadays, a lot of linguistics research uses language data from Twitter. At every major linguistics conference, there&amp;rsquo;s at least one or two people (if not more!) discussing the use of language on this popular social network. Even though doing research on language use on Twitter is quite trendy now, getting the data for research is not that cool. The reason behind this? There are several ways to get Twitter data and each way depends on a variety of factors, which makes the process a bit confusing.</description>
