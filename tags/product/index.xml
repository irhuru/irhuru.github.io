      <description>Chatbots, although a trendy product now, have existed for decades. Advances in AI have transformed chatbots from simple and rule-based systems to more complex and sophisticated conversational agents. Letâ€™s dive into the history of chatbots, from their beginnings to the modern AI-driven companions we see today.
ELIZA: The first chatbot (1966) ELIZA was the first chatbot, developed by professor Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT. ELIZA was designed to mimic a psychotherapist, responding to users&#39; messages with pre-defined responses using pattern matching.</description>

      <description>If you ask Amazon Alexa if it is a woman, it will answer &#34;I&#39;m not a woman, I&#39;m an AI&#34;. In fact, the majority of AI virtual assistants are designed to be genderless (think of AI virtual assistants like Siri, Cortana, or Google Assistant). After all, they are simply made of code. Surprisingly, most of these AI virtual assistants use clear female voices when interacting with users. But, why is that?</description>

      <description>Synthetic voices, or artificial voices, are part of our lives (who has never talked to iPhone&#39;s Siri, Amazon Alexa, or Microsoft Cortana?). Conversational AI, which largely relies on these synthetic voices, is currently experiencing a boom and its market is expected to grow even more in the next four years.
However, even though synthetic voices might look like a very new invention, the truth is that they have been around for a long, long time (more than 200 years, actually!</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago, we heard about Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer who claimed that LaMDA, a chatbot that can carry unstructured conversations with people, had a &#39;human soul&#39;. He came to this conclusion after having long, deep conversations with LaMDA, which he later shared with The Washington Post.
What&#39;s striking about this case is that an engineer, who&#39;s supposed to have a thorough technical knowledge about how chatbots work, was fooled into believing the chatbot was actually human!</description>
