      <description>The arrival of ChatGPT at the end of last year has sparked a debate about how it could impact several different fields, ranging from education, to content creation, to finance and to many others. This NLP tool is the epitome of generative AI, a type of technology that “generates” content, hence the name, after being trained on large amounts of data. In this case, text data.
From a linguistic perspective, it’s exciting to see how ChatGPT outputs seem natural and convincing, leading many to assert that it behaves in a human-like way.</description>

      <description>Some weeks ago, we heard about Blake Lemoine, a Google engineer who claimed that LaMDA, a chatbot that can carry unstructured conversations with people, had a &#39;human soul&#39;. He came to this conclusion after having long, deep conversations with LaMDA, which he later shared with The Washington Post.
What&#39;s striking about this case is that an engineer, who&#39;s supposed to have a thorough technical knowledge about how chatbots work, was fooled into believing the chatbot was actually human!</description>

      <description>Some months ago, I bought my first smart speaker: an Amazon echo. Because I live in the U.S., Alexa&#39;s default language was English. Even though I&#39;m a native speaker of Spanish, I can also speak English, so it wasn&#39;t really a problem for me. However, when pronouncing Spanish proper names (e.g., people or places), I would still use my Spanish pronunciation. It turns out Alexa couldn&#39;t understand me unless I anglicized those names (ugh!</description>
