      <description>Emojis are graphic symbols or ideograms that represent not only facial expressions, but also ideas and concepts. Emojis are extremely popular worldwide, primarily in chat and social media. They can appear as an additional element in the sentence, as in &#34;I liked the cake üòä&#34;, or replacing a word, as in &#34;I liked the üç∞&#34;.
From the perspective of large language models (LLMs), emojis are interesting because they convey a semantic as well as a pragmatic meaning.</description>

      <description>Personality is the enduring set of characteristics or qualities that form a person‚Äôs distinctive character. The science of personality has been long studied by psychologists, and multiple tests have been designed to assess personality constructs.
Interestingly, many of these tests follow a linguistic approach, since they are based on a factor analysis of the language used to describe behavior. For example, if someone says they like to ‚Äúhave everything organized and planned‚Äù, that would correlate with a conscientious personality trait.</description>
