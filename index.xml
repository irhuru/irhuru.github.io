      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/dialect-classifier/</guid>
      <description>This project uses machine learning to detect the dialect a particular sentence belongs to. Currently, the model distinguishes between Mexican Spanish üá≤üáΩ and Peninsular Spanish üá™üá∏.
The model is trained on text data coming from subtitles of movies produced both in Mexico and in Spain.
The project was conducted using Python.

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/haiku-generator/</guid>
      <description>This project produces a random haiku generator.
By using texts coming from actual books, a Python script automatically extracts words and outputs a haiku (a text that follows the 5-7-5 syllable rule).
Texts were taken from Project Gutenberg, an online library of more than 60,000 books. Among the Python libraries used for this project were SpaCy and SyllaPy.
You can learn more about this project by reading this blog post or by checking out the code on Github.</description>

      <description>Heritage speakers are a specific type of bilingual speakers who grew up exposed to a home language different from the one spoken by majority in society. When heritage speakers start school, they learn the majority language which, in most cases, ends up being their dominant language üó£Ô∏è.
In the context of the United States üá∫üá∏, some colleges offer language courses specifically designed for heritage speakers, whereas others offer only mixed language courses (i.</description>

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/projects/bilinmid_corpus/</guid>
      <description>This corpus documents the Spanish and English spoken by bilinguals living in the Midwest of the United States. The corpus comprises written transcriptions of the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale as narrated by several bilingual speakers. These stories were elicited using a children&amp;rsquo;s book (containing only images, not text) üìñ.
Bilingual speakers were either born in the United States or in a Spanish-speaking country (e.g., Mexico, Spain&amp;hellip;), and they were fluent in both English and Spanish, though their level of proficiency differed based on individual variables, such as length of residence in the United States, country of birth, etc.</description>

      <title>Phonetic transcription systems you should know</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/phonetic-transcription/</link>

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/phonetic-transcription/</guid>
      <description>What is phonetic transcription? Phonetic transcription is the use of phonetic symbols to represent speech. We could say it&amp;rsquo;s a way to visually represent speech sounds, which is important because orthography often doesn&amp;rsquo;t represent pronunciation accurately.
Each phonetic symbol represents a sound in a spoken utterance. However, which phonetic symbol we use depends on the phonetic transcription system we follow. This means that the same dataset can be transcribed in more than one way.</description>

      <description>Some months ago, I bought my first smart speaker: an Amazon echo. Because I live in the U.S., Alexa&amp;rsquo;s default language was English. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m a native speaker of Spanish, I can also speak English, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a problem for me. However, when pronouncing Spanish proper names (e.g., people or places), I would still use my Spanish pronunciation. It turns out Alexa couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand me unless I anglicized those names (ugh!</description>

      <title>Four key steps for developing guidelines for language data annotation</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/data-annotation-guidelines/</link>

      <description>Whether you want to build a corpus to document an interesting linguistic phenomenon or simply want to have language data to train your AI models, the process of data annotation is crucial.
Language data annotation (or text data annotation) is the process of adding labels with relevant information or meta-data. Even though it might seem like a simple process, choosing the right labels for your data is not always easy, as ambiguous data is pretty common üò£.</description>

      <title>How to get Twitter data</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/twitter-data/</link>

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/twitter-data/</guid>
      <description>Nowadays, a lot of linguistics research uses language data from Twitter. At every major linguistics conference, there&amp;rsquo;s at least one or two people (if not more!) discussing the use of language on this popular social network. Even though doing research on language use on Twitter is quite trendy now, getting the data for research is not that cool. The reason behind this? There are several ways to get Twitter data and each way depends on a variety of factors, which makes the process a bit confusing.</description>

      <title>What is Latex and why you need to use it for your linguistics papers</title>
      <link>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/latex-docs/</link>

      <guid>https://irhuru.github.io/blog/latex-docs/</guid>
      <description>Linguistics papers often include tons of visual information, such as syntax trees, IPA symbols, glosses, and so on. These things are cool because they are helpful to convey your message, but they are sometimes hard to manage when writing your paper with a standard word processor. Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t drawn a syntax tree using PowerPoint and then taken a screenshot of it to include it in a Word doc? üôÑ
Fortunately, Latex exists so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with these issues.</description>

      <description>If you are into language research, you probably use R to analyze your data üìä. One of the good things about R is that you can install packages to extend R&amp;rsquo;s basic functions. In this blog post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce you to a very useful package for language research: koRpus.
Despite its name, the R package koRpus was designed to work with individual texts, and not with a collection of texts (I know, this is confusing!</description>

      <description>In a previous blog post, I wrote about automatic transcription software that you can use to speed up your transcription process. However, chances are that you also want to analyze what you transcribe if you&amp;rsquo;re working on a research project. Measures such as words per minute or lexical diversity scores are quite common in linguistics research. In this blog post, I introduce you to CLAN, a software that will help you with both transcription and analysis üëáüèª.</description>

      <description>Chances are that if you are working on a linguistics project, you might have to transcribe audio recordings in order to analyze them. Transcribing can be a deadly boring process üò©, especially if you have many files or if you are dealing with speakers of non-standard dialects/varieties.
However, recent advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have led to the development of very cool software that can help you speed up the transcription process.</description>

      <description>I recently discovered the fascinating world of Twitter bots (what&amp;rsquo;s that?). Isn&amp;rsquo;t it amazing that a simple computer program can post random stuff on Twitter all by itself? üòé‚ú® It probably isn&amp;rsquo;t, considering that we&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a tech revolution, but they&amp;rsquo;re fun to build, so that&amp;rsquo;s a good enough reason to waste your time creating one!
In this guide, I explain you how to build a Twitter bot from scratch step by step.</description>

      <description>What is a haiku? I&amp;rsquo;m sure you have heard the term haiku at least once in your life. Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan üáØüáµ. These pieces of poetry consist of three phrases, where the first and third line have 5 syllables each and the second one has 7 syllables. This makes a total of 17 syllables per poem which follow a 5-7-5 pattern.</description>

      <description>As a linguist, I have always been curious about how computers can make sense of texts that combine different languages or language varieties. Therefore, I decided to learn more about this and implemented a dialect classifier. That is, an algorithm that would take some text as input and would determine the language variety (or dialect) it represents. To find out how I did it, read this post or take a look at this Jupyter notebook with all the code!</description>
